The AI engineer successfully completed the initial MVP to multi-channel platform development, implementing core modules like Contacts, Catalogue & Reservations, Advanced WhatsApp Campaigns, AI Assistant, and Reminders & Automations. The project underwent a major rebranding to BoostTribe, including logo and asset updates, and a comprehensive search-and-replace of Afroboost across the frontend. New backend models and API routes for Gift Cards, Discounts, Referrals, and AdChat were created, along with corresponding frontend pages and navigation links. PWA enhancements and Admin free access features were also integrated.

Following a critical bug report from the user, the AI engineer addressed password reset issues, chat functionality, and catalog management, including setting up an admin account and fixing a missing  import. The current focus is on implementing a comprehensive Intelligent Public Advertising Chat with new backend models, public routes for products and checkout, and initial AI service integration. The engineer is now working on public chat backend models and routes, including user presence.

<product_requirements>
The BoostTribe application is an intelligent, trilingual (FR/EN/DE) multichannel marketing platform for coaches, sellers, and creators. Its primary goal is to manage contacts, execute targeted email/WhatsApp campaigns, sell products/events, handle payments (in simulation), and automate communication via AI. Key features include robust authentication, role-based access, email campaign management, advanced contact management, analytics, AI content generation, integrated calendar, pricing plans, PWA, and multilingual support.
Existing modules cover a Catalogue & Reservations system, advanced WhatsApp campaigns, an AI Assistant, and Reminders/Automation. The BoostTribe update introduced Gift Cards, Client Discounts, a Referral System, Direct Chat from Ads, PWA enhancements, and a new favicon.
Recent priorities include:
1.  **Catalogue Visibility & Sharing**: Products/catalogue must be easily shareable via direct links, WhatsApp, and email, with automatic link insertion in campaigns for direct purchase.
2.  **Integrated Payments**: Buy Now buttons for direct purchases from WhatsApp/Email (Stripe/Twint simulation).
3.  **Intelligent Advertising Chat**: An interactive AI-powered chat capable of selling, advising, remembering conversations, recognizing returning clients, and escalating to human coaches when necessary. This includes linking to products/gift cards, user memory (email/WhatsApp ID), and WhatsApp Business API synchronization.
4.  **Referral System**: Users can define their own referral gains (money, free course, discount).
5.  **API-less Mode**: Core functionalities must work even without external API keys (LLM, payment, WhatsApp).
6.  **Automated Notifications**: Reminders for courses, confirmed bookings, payments, and scheduled campaigns.
7.  **PWA Enhancements**: Improve offline capabilities and installation prompts.
