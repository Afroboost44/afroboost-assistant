<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully led the development of Afroboost Mailer, transitioning it from an MVP to a robust multi-channel platform. Initial work focused on core functionalities like authentication, password reset, and the first iteration of the Contacts module. A significant portion of the trajectory involved completing MODULE 3 (Catalogue & Reservations) with backend models, CRUD routes, and frontend pages, along with a complex debugging phase for email sending functionality. Persistent external URL/deployment issues were identified as Kubernetes routing problems with the Emergent platform, which were documented but couldn't be resolved by the engineer. Subsequently, MODULE 2 (Advanced WhatsApp Campaigns), MODULE 5 (AI Assistant with Emergent LLM Key), MODULE 1 (Contacts with direct WhatsApp messaging), and MODULE 4 (Reminders & Automations) were all implemented. The project is now poised for a major rebranding to BoostTribe, with new features like Gift Cards and a Referral System planned, and the immediate task being logo and asset creation.
